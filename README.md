# Aquilifer Dashboard

This project is used to assist in playing a Stars Without Number game with friends remotely.

The app itself will ultimately rely on an API linked here once it's tossed into a repo.

## Setup

1. Install at least Node 20.16, recommend using node version manager
2. Pull this repository
3. From the pulled repository, run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run dev`
5. View application on localhost:5173

## Outstanding Work

1. Attach the react app to the backing API
2. Dockerize the database + react app for local development
3. Build out the remainder of core screens
   - Character Panels
   - Character Creation
   - Ship Details
   - Combat Panels
   - Map Generation / Encounter Maps
